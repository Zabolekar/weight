Example usage:

`weight cat`

`weight plot`

`weight add 75.2`

Requires Python 3.6 or later, `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`.
We recommend to place it in a separate directory, e.g. `~/weights/`,
and to add `alias weight='python ~/weights/weight.py'` (or a more
sophisticated command taking virtual environments into account)
to your `.bashrc` (adapt for your system and shell accordingly).
